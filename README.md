iMat

This was a school project at Chalmers University of Technology in the course Design and implementation of graphical interfaces, DAT216.

The backend, which is pre-compiled, is in the lib folder and has to be selected as library.

All images and other resources needed for the backend can be found [here](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/4110/files/87456/download?wrap=1).

Unzip the resources folder and copy the imat folder to the .dat216 folder in your home directory.
